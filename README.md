## 📌 Key Features
- ♻️ **Rainwater Recycling**: Collects and reuses rainfall from a 50L barrel
- 💧 **Precision Irrigation**: Waters only when soil moisture < threshold (adjustable)
- ☀️ **Off-Grid Operation**: 10W solar panel + 18650 battery pack
- 📊 **Data Logging**: Tracks moisture/watering events (CSV or cloud upload)
- 💰 **Low-Cost**: < $150 total (RPi + Arduino + affordable sensors)

## 🛠️ Hardware Components
| Component               | Purpose                                  |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Raspberry Pi 4          | Main controller (data logging/pump control) |
| Arduino Uno             | Reads analog soil moisture sensor        |
| Capacitive Soil Sensor  | Measures real-time moisture % (0-100%)   |
| 5V Water Pump           | Delivers water from rain barrel          |
| Relay Module            | Safely controls pump with Pi GPIO        |
| 10W Solar Panel         | Charges battery during daylight          |
| 18650 Battery + TP4056  | Energy storage for night operation       |
| 50L Water Barrel        | Rainwater collection                     |

## 📊 Performance Metrics
After **8 weeks** of continuous monitoring:

### Water Savings
| Metric                | Value       |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| Manual watering       | 120L/week   |
| Automated system      | 72L/week    |
| **Reduction**         | **40%**     |

> **Peaks** show pump activations (only when moisture <20%). No unnecessary watering.

### Crop Health Insights
- ✅ **Optimal range**: 20–60% moisture (plants showed 30% faster growth vs manual)
- ⚠️ **Stress detected**: <15% moisture triggered leaf curling
- 🚫 **Root rot prevention**: Zero instances of sustained >80% moisture

### System Efficiency
- 🔋 **Solar performance**: 10W panel maintained 4.2V battery even on cloudy days
- ⚡ **Power draw**: 0.8W idle / 5W during pumping
- 🛠️ **Maintenance**: Required sensor recalibration every 2 weeks
